# About This Project

This script is a little project I completed during my data analytics bootcamp.
I enjoy working within SQL and wanted to find a way to query a SQL database using SQLite syntax while in Python.
This is the result!

The script will:
1.  Import modules.
2.  Create a dictionary based on ".db" files found in the databases' children directories.
3.  Create a function that pulls the dictionary information to change the working directory to the proper folder for the input .db file name, checks if it exists, and successfully/unsuccessfully connects to it.
4.  Queries the database using SQLite syntax.
5.  Closes the connection to the database.
